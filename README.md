# React Router Dom v6 Nested Routes Not Rendering

This repository demonstrates a common issue with nested routes in React Router Dom v6 where nested routes fail to render even when the parent route path is matched.

## Problem
The provided code uses nested routes to structure the application. However, the nested route components do not render, resulting in a blank page or unexpected behavior. This often occurs due to improper route configuration or missing components.

## Solution
The solution involves checking the route configuration and ensuring the necessary component structures are in place.  This includes ensuring the nested route's path is relative to its parent and the components are correctly exported and imported.
